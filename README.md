## Requirements

## Generating the App Icon

Place your 1024√ó1024 PNG (e.g. a tomato üçÖ) at the project root named `AppIcon-1024.png`, then run:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/generate_app_icon.sh
./scripts/generate_app_icon.sh
```

This creates an `Icon.icns` inside `ttcd/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`, which Xcode will use as the app's icon.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `ttcd.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3.  Press `Cmd+R` to build and run.

The app will appear as a üçÖ icon in your macOS menu bar. Click it to start your first focus session!

## Configuration

`ttcd` uses Supabase for storing session history. To keep your API
credentials out of the source code, the app reads them from environment
variables at runtime:

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_KEY="your-anon-key"
```

You can set these in your shell profile or add them to an `.env` file and
load it with your preferred tool when developing locally.
